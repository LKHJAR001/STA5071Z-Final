The study evaluates the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market by simulating trading within two cryptocurrency 
exchanges, and arbitrage between them, using an agent-based model (utilizing Netlogo). The study is divided into an 
examination of the arbitrage mechanics in the market and the trading strategies that can be employed to generate 
profits - including two commonly utilized momentum-based indicators employed by traders involving moving-averages. 
Additionally, we propose that this study serves as an introductory guide for individuals interested in analyzing 
their own specific trading strategies using the provided NetLogo program (btc_new.nlogo). Attached R code (btc.Rmd)
may be found as well which contains the study's post-processing (Contact author for associated csv files used in 
the study - generated from Netlogo's Behaviour Space).
